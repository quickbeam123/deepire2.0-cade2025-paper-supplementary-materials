Supplementary materials for reproducing experiments reported in the the CADE 2025 submission titled "Efficient Neural Clause-Selection Reinforcement"

The subdirectory tptpOverfit100 contains proofs of the 49 hard TPTP problems (rating 1.0, never re-rated), as well as the models used to find them. The first line in each proof file is how Vampire was invoked to find the proof. (This includes random_seed values and sometimes non-zero temperature settting.)
